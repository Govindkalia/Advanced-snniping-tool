# Advanced-snniping-tool
A reliable tool for users for snipping image and then converting it to text file This is a program that allows the user to snip text on their screen and this text will be automatically recognized and search in google or saved to clipboard or user can choose a snipped file(img) and convert it to string and copy to clipboard as well. The .exe file will only work on windows and has not been tested on any machine other than mine. Tips for use:

Copying large chunks of text across multiple lines is likely to result in erroneous text recognition. Short, one line snippets works best.
Be mindful that punctuation seem to be harder to recognize.
Choose the file format precisely. Enjoy the Code!!
